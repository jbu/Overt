<h1>Movie Recommendations - How to use me</h1>
The colourful panel on the left contains a large number of movie titles.
<p>
Moving your mouse over the movie titles highlights the title, and shows
the title and it's recommendation in the status bar of the browser.
<p>
If the movie title you want is in a clump of other titles, 
it may be a little difficult to select. In this case, either use the
search menu, or click on another movie and hope the clump separates.
<p>
Any movie title may be selected by clicking on it. 
<p>
When an item is selected, movies that have
a similar cast or writer or director are exposed and brightened as well.
<p>
The colour of the movie title (<font color='red'>red</font>, 
<font color='green'>green</font> or sometimes 
<font color='yellow'>yellow</font>) tells you how much
we think you would like that movie. Green means we think you would like it,
red you wouldn't like it, and yellow means we don't know. The saturation of
the colour indicates how much we think so, so a dull green movie is 
less recommended than a 'fluro' green movie.
<p>
We indicate how certain we are of our recommendation by indenting
titles from the left side. The closer the title is to the left side, the 
more certain we are of our recommendation.
<p>
You can adjust the point at which the colours switch from green to
red (like adjusting how hard to mark the movies) with the slider at the top.
<p>
The Actions menu allows you to view information about the currently selected 
movie, or to search for a specific movie title. The search can be
a substring or a full regular expression.
