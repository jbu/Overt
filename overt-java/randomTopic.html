        <P><B>Linkages between personality and disease</B></P>
        
        <P>Increasing evidence supports the view that personality is related to
          the development of disease and influences disease outcomes. Although
          the research is promising, the methodological issues are complex and
          more refined measurement of personality constructs and prospective
          studies are required. Relationships between disease end-points and
          personality may depend on one or a number of mechanisms other than
          simple linear causation. It is especially important to emphasise that
          correlation does not equal causation. Observed correlations may
          reflect a range of processes including: (1.) direct causation; (2.)
          reverse causation - where disease processes overtly or covertly
          influence aspects of personality functioning; (3.) co-varying risk
          behaviours (behavioural third variables); (4.) physiological third
          variables; and (5.) research artefacts.</P>
        
        <P><B>Personality</B></P>
        
        <P>Personality refers to the patterns of cognitive, affective, and
          behavioural dispositions that characterise individuals. Personality
          patterns are thought to be relatively stable across time and context.
          For an overview of the main approaches to describing personality and
          theories of personality development, it will be useful to read chapter
          14 of the Philipchalk and McConnell textbook. There is now fairly
          broad consensus that broad classifications of personality can be made
          on the basis of the &quot;Big Five&quot; traits: Extroversion
          (gregarious, enthusiastic, daring); Agreeableness (affectionate,
          gentle, empathic, cooperative); Conscientiousness (organised,
          reliable, persevering); Emotional stability (poised, calm, composed);
          Intelligence (intellectual, reflective, imaginative). Research is also
          attempting to identify more specific personality factors that
          contribute to effectiveness and adaptiveness, influencing sickness and
          health.</P>
        
        <P><B>Personality and CHD (coronary heart disease)</B></P>
        
        <P>The linkages between heart disease and &quot;Type A personality
          behaviour&quot; have been studied extensively. The key features of the
          Type A behaviour pattern are: hostility, time urgency, impatience and
          competitiveness. Friedman and Rosenman first described Type A
          behaviour on the basis of structured interviews in which they observed
          tense facial and body musculature, rapid body movements, explosive
          conversational speech, and hand or teeth clenching. Since then more
          convenient methods, such as self-report questionnaires, have been used
          though it seems that they do not measure precisely the same construct.
          Three major prospective investigations and a series of case-control
          studies found Type A behaviour to be a significant risk factor for
          developing CHD. More recent evidence, however, has suggested that once
          CHD is present or in high-risk populations, Type A Behaviour does not
          markedly increase the risk of subsequent morbid events. </P>
        
        <P><B>Hostility</B></P>
        
        <P>Given the inability of measurements of Type A behaviour to predict
          risk of morbid events following the initial incidence of CHD,
          investigative focus has shifted toward identifying those elements of
          the construct most strongly associated with CHD. With more
          conventional risk factors statistically controlled (eg. heredity,
          obesity, diet and smoking) this research has indicated that expressive
          hostility, particularly antagonistic interactions with others
          (anger-out), appears most strongly implicated with ongoing risk. Other
          hostility related constructs, including cynical mistrust, potential
          for hostility, and suppressed resentment (anger-in) have also been
          found to predict CHD mortality and morbidity. </P>
        
        <P>Other clusters of psychological variables that are currently being
          investigated with respect to multiple disease outcomes are emotional
          suppression, depressive symptoms, and the adoption of a pessimistic or
          fatalistic attitude to life and health.</P>
        
        <P><B>Psychological hardiness</B></P>
        
        <P>There is evidence that certain personality constellations may be
          associated with positive health outcomes. Kobasa introduced the notion
          of psychological hardiness made up of three characteristics: sense of
          control, commitment, and the viewing of change as exciting challenge
          rather than threat. </P> <FONT FACE="Arial"><B>References</B></FONT>
