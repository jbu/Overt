<h1>Online Assessment Results - How to use me</h1>
The colourful panel on the left contains learning topic titles.
Any title may be brought to the top by clicking on it. 
<br>
When an item is brought to the top (after being cliked on), topics that have
a similar name are exposed and brightened as well.
<br>
The colour of the topic title, (<font color='red'>red</font>, 
<font color='green'>green</font> or sometimes 
<font color='yellow'>yellow</font>) tells you how well you have been doing
in that topic. Green means you have been getting better than the 'pass' mark
red worse, and yellow means we don't know. The saturation of
the colour indicates how much better or worse, so a dull green title is 
not as good as a 'fluro' green title.
<br>
You can adjust the point at which the colours switch from green to
red (like adjusting the pass mark) with the slider at the top.
<br>
We indicate how much evidence we have for the score by indenting
titles from the left side. The closer the title is to the left side, the 
surer we are of the mark.
<br>
The Actions menu allows you to search the titles, or go back a selection.
<p>
The Display menu lets you choose which data to show.
